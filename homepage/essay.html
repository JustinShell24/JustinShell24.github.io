      <h1 class="mb-4">Restaurants</h1>
        <p>Everywhere I look, I see new restaurants opening and closing.</p>
        <p>My neighborhood, the Upper East Side, does not have many restaurants that I can find that lasted for multiple years. There are always opportunities to open up new restaurants, but it is also really difficult  to compete in the food industry and pay such a high cost of rent. There are always frequent and loyal customers who come and support the restaurants, but the truth is there is always a high chance of closing down in the city. Regardless of how popular and famous a restaurant is, nobody realizes how quickly it can come and go.</p>
        <p>When I was younger, a new meatball restaurant opened nearby. It was known for making great meatballs and giving away pots. Their meatballs were so delicious that within a couple weeks they made the news. I could not believe how famous this small restaurant had become. But a couple months later, when I went to go to the restaurant, it was gone. How can a restaurant that just opened and went on the news for being so good, close in such a short time? There was not even a warning and it just happened so suddenly. We know that these restaurant owners would love to stay in the city and serve their loyal customers who always come every Saturday night and order the same few dishes. These establishments aim to serve their customers, who come for every special occasion they can find such as birthdays, anniversaries, or promotions. But the problem with the city is that because of the amount of opportunities in the city, there are too many restaurants that serve the same types of food. This competition between restaurants leads to customers splitting up between each restaurant, with most of the customers going to the oldest and biggest restaurant of each type of food. Due to the lack of customers in the newer restaurants, the owners struggle to keep the restaurant open. On the other hand, the older restaurants are usually more likely to stay open because it grew its restaurant early in the creation of the city, and passed it down through generations. Throughout the years, these restaurants have stayed consistent and created many generations of loyal customers. However, they still have multiple possibilities of closing. Some restaurants have new chefs who can not cook the recipes as well as the previous ones, making the food unreliable. Other restaurants have new bosses that cause changes to the consistency that customers have come to expect over time. Still, other restaurants have non-loyal customers who simply stop going to that restaurant. All of these factors lead to lack of customers, a price hike in food, and end in the same result, the collapse of a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Even though most customers in New York City do not seem loyal to their restaurants and just go to a different restaurant when one closes, they are more loyal than it seems. They would not want to eat at the new restaurant that has taken its place in the neighborhood. The customers will instead search through the whole neighborhood and try different places just to find one that can fill the old restaurant's shoes. They hope that they can find new owners and waiters who are as friendly and welcoming as the ones that the old restaurant had. These consumers search through newly opened restaurants and long-lasting old ones for food that can be as tasteful and as affordable as what they were used to at the old restaurant. These customers also look for an atmosphere that brings a sense of comfort, culture, or adventure as they walk in. As they search for the perfect restaurant, each one contains a different vibrant feeling. The longer the search, the harder it is to find one to be loyal to. There are so many different unique restaurants to explore, but none are as delicious or memorable as the first, the original. However, it is possible to then find multiple new favorite restaurants.</p>
        <p>As New Yorkers make new memories in new restaurants, they know that there is a strong chance of losing them. One can go to these restaurants as many times as they can while the restaurant is still open. When the time comes and the new restaurant must close, these New Yorkers might be disappointed. However, they are already used to searching for another new restaurant, which leads to a never ending cycle.</p>
